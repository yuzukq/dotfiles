## My favorite oss
### For windows
- [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) : my favorite Window Manager looks like Hyprland for windows. Provides window operations that can be completed using only the keyboard and beautiful tiled windows.
- [YASB Reborn](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb) : A highly configurable Windows status bar written in Python.It works well with GlazeWM and offers a variety of widgets. Additionally, creating custom styles is straightforward.
- [Windhawk](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk): This is an open-source Windows customization marketplace. I use it to modify Alt+Tab behavior and customize the taskbar.
- [Mechvibes](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes/) : One of the only free applications that'll let you to change the sound of your  keyboard into anything! It drowns out the deep, resonant sound of laptop keystrokes.
